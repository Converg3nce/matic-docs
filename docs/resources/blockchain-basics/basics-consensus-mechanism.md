title: Consensus Mechanism
---

A Consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies.

## Types of Consensus Mechanism

1. PoW: Proof of Work <br></br>
Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter dos(denial-of-service) attacks and other malicious attacks. It requires to solve a computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in Blockchain.

2. PoS: Proof of Stake <br></br>
Proof-of-Stake mechanism achieve consensus by requiring users to stake an amount of their tokens so as to have a chance of being selected to validate blocks of transactions, and get rewarded for doing so. Priority is given to miners who have purchased the most stake in the blockchain system.

3. DPoS: Delegated Proof of Stake <br></br>
This forms of consensus mirrors the election of members in governing bodies. Witnesses, those who validate transactions, are elected.
