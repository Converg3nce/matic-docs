# 2-min guide to get started on Matic

Block time on the Matic testnet is ~1s.

### Deploy smart contracts

* If you are already developing contracts on Ethereum, just configure the Web3 Provider URL to https://testnetv3.matic.network
* Everything else remains the same
* Matic Mainnet will have PoS security, with greater Plasma guarantees being added

### Bring Ropsten assets (ERC20/ERC721) to the Matic testnet using Plasma

* To get TEST tokens on Ropsten you can access the Matic Faucet: https://faucet.matic.network

* Ropsten TEST token contract address - `0x28C8713DDe7F063Fdc4cA01aB2A8856e0F243Fec`

* Use [matic.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) to interact with the Matic Plasma contracts. Go to  the [maticjs walkthrough](https://docs.matic.network/matic-js-tutorial/).

The flow for this would be:

* Deposit assets from Ropsten to Matic - [deposit-ERC20.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js/blob/master/examples/node/deposit-ERC20.js)
* Fast transfers on the Matic Plasma sidechain - [transfer-ERC20.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js/blob/master/examples/node/transfer-ERC20.js)
* Withdraw from Matic to Ropsten - [initiate-withdraw-ERC20.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js/blob/master/examples/node/initiate-withdraw-ERC20.js) >> (wait for ~5 mins) >>
[confirm-withdraw.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js/blob/master/examples/node/confirm-withdraw.js) >> (wait for ~5 mins) >>
[process-exit-ERC20.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js/blob/master/examples/node/process-exit-ERC20.js)
