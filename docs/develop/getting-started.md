Welcome to the most exciting and innovative platform to build your blockchain application on **Matic Blockchain**. Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionise the way the digital world handles data and does business. Be a part of this revolution and get a head start with decentralised application development on Matic.

This page will act as your guide into the **Matic Ecosystem**. You'll find links to some useful resources and websites to get you up and started with building on Matic in particular and Blockchain in general. Feel free to reach out to us on Telegram/Discord. 

## **Developer Quick Start**

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a Matic developer. 
All the tools you're familiar with are supported on Matic out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js. 
Switch over to Matic's RPC and get started!

Matic Test Network details:
Network: **Matic Testnetv3,** connects with **Ethereum's Ropsten Testnet.** 
Details: [Network](https://docs.matic.network/docs/integrate/network/) 

- [Setup Metamask Wallet](/docs/develop/metamask/hello)
* Deploy your Contracts on Matic Network
    - [Using Remix](/docs/develop/remix)
    - [Using Truffle](/docs/develop/truffle)

- [Connecting to Matic with RPC](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/testnet) - adding Matic network on Metamask.
    - Same RPC can be used with web3js

        ```jsx
        // Javascript 

        const Web3 = require('Web3')
        const web3 = new Web3('https://testnetv3.matic.network')

        // web3 object is now connected with Matic's node
        ```

### **ü¶ï Already have a dApp?**

- **Migrating from Ethereum chain (or any EVM based chain for that matter)**

    Deploy all your smart contracts directly on Matic chain. You don't have to worry about the underlying architecture, as long as it is EVM compatible!

    - [Deploying your dApp on Matic](https://docs.matic.network/docs/integrate/quickstart)
- **Using Matic as a faster transactions layer**

    Using Matic as a transactions layer in your DApp deployed on Mainnet, you can get started with getting your tokens mapped by us.

    - Getting your tokens mapped on Matic: Read about mapping [here](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/advanced/mapping-assets)

# **Keeping Up with Development**

### **Social Media**

Dapp development encourages network decentralization, and it also embodies it. Developers are located everywhere in the world! As such, social media has become important to keep people in touch across time zones. Besides the popular platforms, you may be less familiar with platforms such as Telegram, Discord and Gitter.

## Pointers

If this is overwhelming, that‚Äôs okay! You can jump right into the fire and start hacking. Here are a few pointers before you start diving into resources, repositories, and documentation.

1. **Beware the cost of being on the bleeding edge**¬†More so than typical niche programming, dapp and blockchain development moves very quickly. Deep into learning, you may find complex code repositories, 404s on a documentation site, or, perhaps, no documentation at all. Rather than seeing this as a deterrent, see it as an invitation to a **Opportunity**. Ping on our developer channel, find the Discord / Gitter / Telegram channel, post on Stack Overflow or Reddit ‚Äî you may be surprised at the rate of response and openness of the community.
2. **The learning curve may be daunting, but the barrier to entry is low**. All communities have their grumps, of course, but if you do the work, put in the effort, it will be noticed. Projects welcome pull requests from outsiders and support will be there if you‚Äôve exhausted every other resource. We‚Äôre working on creating a better world and can use all the help we can get. We‚Äôre just glad you‚Äôre here.
