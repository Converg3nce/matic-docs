How to connect to Matic to Metamask, please refer this [guide](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-matic)

Once you access this page, you will be requested to connect to your MetaMask account. Note that currently the Matic Web Wallet supports MetaMask, WalletConnect and Wallet Link. We will gradually add support for more wallets.
