# Full Node Deployment (Mumbai testnet)

We have created simple Ansible playbooks to setup a full node.

Pre-requisite:

- Ansible should be installed on local machine with Python3.x. The setup will not work if you have Python2.x.
    - To install ansible with Python 3.x you can use this command `pip3 install ansible`. This will install Python 3 dependencies as well as ansible.
- Check [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#requirements) for requirements
- You will also need to make sure that Go is not installed on your VM / Machine. Setting up your full node through ansible will run into issues if you have Go already installed, as ansible requires specific packages of Go to be installed.
- You will also need to make sure that your VM / Machine does not have any previous setups for Matic Validator or Heimdall or Bor. You will need to delete them as your setup will run into issues.

Setup full node for Testnetv4/Mumbai testnet

- Ensure you have access to the remote machine or VM that the full node is being setup on. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#setup) for more details.
- Clone the [`https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible`](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible) repo
- `cd node-ansible`
- Edit the `inventory.yml` file and insert your IP(s) in the `sentry->hosts` section. Refer [https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory](https://github.com/maticnetwork/node-ansible#inventory) for more details.
- Check if remote machine is reachable by running `ansible sentry -m ping`
- For a test run to confirm if the correct remote machine / VM is configured, run the following command:

    `ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.0 heimdall_branch=v0.2.0 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry" --list-hosts`

    It should output the remote machine IP(s) you have configured

    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/network/full-node-mumbai.png")} />

- Setup the full node with this command:

    `ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/network.yml --extra-var="bor_branch=v0.2.0 heimdall_branch=v0.2.0 network_version=testnet-v4 node_type=sentry/sentry"`

- In case you run into any issues, delete and clean the whole setup using

    `ansible-playbook -l sentry playbooks/clean.yml`

- Login to the remote machine
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/config.toml`:
    - `moniker=<enter unique identifier>`
    - `seeds="4cd60c1d76e44b05f7dfd8bab3f447b119e87042@54.147.31.250:26656"`
- Configure the following in `~/.heimdalld/config/heimdall-config.toml`:
    - `eth_rpc_url =<insert Infura or any full node RPC URL to Goerli>`
- Add the following flag in `~/node/bor/start.sh` to the `bor` start params:

```bash
--bootnodes "enode://320553cda00dfc003f499a3ce9598029f364fbb3ed1222fdc20a94d97dcc4d8ba0cd0bfa996579dcc6d17a534741fb0a5da303a90579431259150de66b597251@54.147.31.250:30303"
```

- In case you want to turn `trace` on for Bor, add the following flag to the `bor` start params in `~/node/bor/start.sh`:
    - `--gcmode 'archive'`

- Run the full node with the following commands:
    - `sudo service heimdalld start`
    - `sudo service heimdalld-rest-server start`

    Once Heimdall is synced, run 

    - `sudo service bor start`

- Check logs:
    - Heimdall - `journalctl -u heimdalld.service -f`
    - Heimdall Rest Server - `journalctl -u heimdalld-rest-server.service -f`
    - Bor - `journalctl -u bor.service -f`

- To check if Heimdall is synced
    - On the remote machine/VM, run `curl localhost:26657/status`
    - In the output, `catching_up` value should be `false`
