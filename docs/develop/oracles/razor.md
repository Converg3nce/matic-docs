Razor Network consists of validators who lock in their tokens as a “Stake” and provide data to the network. The honest validators are rewarded and those who report incoherently are penalised.

The core of Razor Network is a set of smart contracts, that can run on any Ethereum compatible blockchain. Razor relies on the underlying blockchain for providing certain properties such as censorship resistance, security from network partition attacks, etc.

### Usage

This oracle network is currently running on Görli testnet. A "[Bridge](https://github.com/razor-network/bridge)", which picks results from the network and delivers them to Matic Network. To get started with connecting to the data feed, check out this **[Tutorial](https://docs.razor.network/tutorial/matic/)**

- The bridge has been updated with more features and linked to razorscan [https://matic.razor.network/](https://matic.razor.network/) (Make sure to connect metamask to matic testnet!)
- [Sample DApp](https://matic-king.netlify.com/) (Make sure to connect Metamask to Matic testnet (`http://testnet2.matic.network`))
