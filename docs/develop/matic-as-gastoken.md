MATIC token is the native token of matic network. This is similar to Ether in Ethereum. For recording transactions on the matic network, matic tokens are required to pay the gas fees.

- On the Matic chain, the Matic tokens works as an ERC20 token, but also as the native token, both at the same time. This means that a user can pay gas with MATIC as well as send MATIC to other accounts.
- The balance of both the native Matic native token and Matic ERC20 remains the same always. Each time gas (native matic) is spent, the balance of the Matic ERC20 token will also be reduced.

- Getting the Matic token is really easy. You can deposit MATIC token from Ethereum to matic using the Matic web wallet. 

- On Ethereum, the matic ERC20 token can be purchased from the following exchanges :-
